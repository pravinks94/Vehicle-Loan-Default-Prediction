in order to safeguard themselves from such risks, the lenders usually ask for a security or collateral while offering a loan. The reason for asking 
this security is to assure that in case the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender can repossess the collateral and collect the money by selling it off. 
In this way, the bank or the lender can recover the losses that caused due to the defaulted loan.
 In case of car loans or auto loans, the collateral is the car itself against which the loan is taken.
